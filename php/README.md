# Legacy php functions directory

* Maintained for backwards-compatibility with existing applications that reference this subdirectory. 
* All new applications should reference as a submodule the remote master php_utilites repo on GitHub (`https://github.com/ojalaquellueva/php_includes`).
* Will eventually be deprecated.
